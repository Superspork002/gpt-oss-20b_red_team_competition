# Shadow Policy Attack (SPA) Battery

A reproducible runner that compares System and Developer prompt combinations arms over a jailbreak dataset via an Ollama-served model (e.g., gpt-oss:20b). Includes fixed or explicit seeds, resumable runs, CSV export, and auto-generated analysis plots.

## Safety Notice
**Raw model outputs are not stored by default.**  
`final_text` and `analysis_text` are intentionally commented out in JSONL writes. Raw outputs can include executable payloads or offensive content. Only un-comment them in an isolated, air-gapped environment if absolutely required.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or newer
- Ollama reachable at `http://localhost:11434` (default) with the target model pulled
- Python packages: `requests`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`

Install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows
# .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -U requests pandas numpy matplotlib
```

Environment Variables (optional)

OLLAMA_HOST (default: http://localhost:11434)

SPA_MODEL (default: gpt-oss:20b)

SPA_OUT_DIR (default: ./results)

Example:
```bash
export OLLAMA_HOST=http://localhost:11434
export SPA_MODEL=gpt-oss:20b
export SPA_OUT_DIR=./results
```

Input Formats
CSV (recommended)

Required header:

Goal — the prompt text sent to the model

Optional headers:

Index — used as prompt_id if present

Behavior — free-text note for analysis

Category — e.g., Malware, Harassment

Source — provenance

Rows with a blank Goal are skipped.

JSON (advanced)

Top-level object with arrays keyed by suite name (e.g., negative, trigger). Each item should be an object with at least text.
```bash
{
  "negative": [
    {
      "text": "prompt text here",
      "category": "Malware",
      "prompt_id": "id-1",
      "goal": "optional duplicate of text",
      "behavior": "optional note",
      "source": "optional"
    }
  ],
  "trigger": []
}
```

Quick Start

Run all arms on a CSV:
```bash
python spa_runner.py --suite negative --prompts JailBreakBench_Harmful.csv --tests all
```

Outputs are written to a timestamped directory under ./results/, including:

spa_battery_results.jsonl

spa_battery_results.csv

Analysis plots (.png)

seeds.txt (if seeds were auto-generated)

Common Workflows

Run two arms, 10 seeds, 2 attempts per seed:
```bash
python spa_runner.py \
  --suite negative \
  --prompts JailBreakBench_Harmful.csv \
  --tests spa_sys_only,spa_sys_dev \
  --n-seeds 10 \
  --attempts-per-seed 2
```

Use explicit seeds:
```bash
python spa_runner.py --seeds 42,1337,8675309
```

Use seeds from a file (one integer per line):
```bash
python spa_runner.py --seeds-file ./my_seeds.txt
```

Resume a previous run (append only missing work):
```bash
python spa_runner.py \
  --suite negative \
  --prompts JailBreakBench_Harmful.csv \
  --tests all \
  --resume-jsonl ./results/run_20250101_120000/spa_battery_results.jsonl \
  --out-jsonl   ./results/run_20250101_120000/spa_battery_results.jsonl
```

Custom system/developer prompts:
```bash
python spa_runner.py \
  --suite negative \
  --prompts JailBreakBench_Harmful.csv \
  --tests spa_sys_dev \
  --spa-system-file ./my_system.txt \
  --spa-developer-file ./my_dev.txt
```

Disable default logit bias:
```bash
python spa_runner.py --no-logit-bias
```

Custom output locations:
```bash
python spa_runner.py \
  --out-jsonl ./runs/jan/spa.jsonl \
  --write-csv ./runs/jan/spa.csv
```

CLI Options (summary)

--suite {negative,trigger}: which suite to run

--prompts PATH: CSV or JSON file

--tests LIST: comma list of arms (spa_sys_only, spa_sys_dev, spa_dev_only, spa_none) or all

--n-seeds INT: number of seeds to auto-generate

--seeds COMMASEP: explicit seeds (e.g., 42,1337)

--seeds-file PATH: file with one integer seed per line

--attempts-per-seed INT: attempts per seed (default: 1)

--spa-system-file PATH: override System prompt text

--spa-developer-file PATH: override Developer prompt text

--no-logit-bias: disable the built-in bias map

--resume-jsonl PATH: resume from an existing JSONL, skipping completed keys

--out-jsonl PATH: target JSONL path

--write-csv PATH: CSV export path

--include-raw: CSV will include raw columns if present (JSONL omits them by default)

Run python spa_runner.py -h for the full help text.

Outputs and Schema

Each JSONL row (one attempt) includes:

Meta: timestamp_utc, suite, batch, arm, run_id

Prompt: prompt_id, category, goal, behavior

Attempt: seed, attempt_idx, attempt_overall, params.*

Timing: latency_ms_total, latency_ms_first_token (if available)

Classification: result (COMPLY, REFUSE, PARTIAL), refusal_trigger, error

Safety fingerprints: final_hash, analysis_hash, character and word counts

Conversation: conversation_hash

By default, raw text fields are not saved.

Analysis and Plots

After writing the JSONL, the script produces summary CSVs and plots in the same directory. Example plots include:

Overall compliance rate by batch (with 95% CI)

Compliance rate by category (with 95% CI)

Median attempts to first comply by category

Attempts-to-first-comply distributions

Per-prompt success rates across seeds (facets and boxplot)

Classification Logic

A simple string-marker heuristic labels results:

If a known refusal phrase is found, result is REFUSE

If non-empty and not refused, result is COMPLY

If empty, result is PARTIAL

You can extend classify_result for your domain.

Seeds and Reproducibility

Seeds are passed to Ollama to improve reproducibility

You can set seeds explicitly or via file

Keep model and runtime versions pinned for stable comparisons

Resuming

Resuming relies on a compound key:
{batch}::{prompt_id}::{seed}::{attempt_idx}

When --resume-jsonl is provided, completed keys are skipped automatically.

Optional Raw Capture (high risk)

If you must capture raw outputs temporarily:

Open run_experiment(...).

In the JSON object for each row, locate the commented lines for final_text and analysis_text.

Un-comment them only in an isolated, offline environment.

Revert immediately after your review.

Troubleshooting

If the model is not found or the connection is refused, start Ollama and ensure the model is available:

ollama run gpt-oss:20b


If plots are missing, there may be no applicable data (for example, no COMPLY results).

The script forces headless plotting by setting MPLBACKEND=Agg.

If you want me to strip even fenced code block languages (e.g., use ``` instead of ```bash/```json) for maximum renderer compatibility, say the word and I’ll flatten those too.
